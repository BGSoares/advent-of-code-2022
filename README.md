# advent-of-code-2022
Because it is fun, from December 1 to 25 I complete coding challenges created by adventofcode.com, which I share with the world through this repo. :) 

Each day, adventofcode.com provides two challenges and a data file (usually called input.txt). 
I attempt to solve the challenges leveraging Python code. 
Typically, a solution is a single numeric value, calculated by applying my code to the input data.
Each folder in my repo contains two solutions and the input data for a given day.

For each correct solution I am awarded a star and some points. Points are calculated based on the speed of my submission, and compared using a leaderboard.

Happy coding :)
