# advent-of-code-2022
In this repo, I provide my solutions to the daily challenges (Dec 1-25) provided by adventofcode.com.

Each day, adventofcode.com provides two challenges and a data file (usually called input.txt). 
I attempt to solve the challenges leveraging Python code. 
Typically, a solution is a single numeric value, calculated by applying my code to the input data.

For each solution, if it is correct I am awarded a star, which adds to my points.
Points are compared in a leaderboard in adventofcode.com and the number of points awareded per correct solution depend on the speed of submission.
